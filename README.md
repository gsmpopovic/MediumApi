# MediumApi
A small PHP SDK to interact with Medium's API, both through 
a 3rd-party API via RapidApi (https://rapidapi.com/nishujain199719-vgIfuFHZxVZ/api/medium2/),
and Medium's official REST API (https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs),
where the former fills in the gaps of the latter (e.g., allowing a user to obtain their own posts).
